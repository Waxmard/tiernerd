## Documentation Automation

`README.md`, `fastapi/README.md`, and `frontend/README.md` are **generated** from templates in `docs/src/` by `scripts/build_docs.py`. Do not edit the generated files directly — edit the template or partial and re-render.

```bash
make docs-build    # render templates → generated files
make docs-check    # fail if generated docs are stale
```

Partials live in `docs/src/partials/` and are included with double-brace `include:partials/<name>.md` directives.

`AGENTS.md` is hand-maintained, not generated — it is the source of truth for agent-facing guidance.
